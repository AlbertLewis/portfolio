            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Hi! I'm Albert, a student at <a href="https://wpi.edu">Worcester Polytechnic Institute</a> (WPI).
                I am currently pursuing a B.S. and M.S. in Robotics Engineering with a Minor in Computer Science. </strong><br>
                My interests are mainly in Artificial Intelligence, Controls, and Motion Planning, 
                but I most enjoy myself when I am put in situations where I can tackle complex challenges, work in a team environment, acquire new skills and broaden my horizons.
                Although my interests are software oriented, I also love working with mechanical and electrical systems as seen from my projects below.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of working, some of my hobbies include playing soccer, cooking, playing the violin, working out, and playing with cats.
            </p>
            <p>
